## Overview

This repository contains coursework, practicums, and a final project completed as part of **DA.5030 â€“ Introduction to Machine Learning & Data Mining**.  
The course covered fundamental techniques in data preprocessing, machine learning, and predictive modeling with a focus on practical implementation in **R**.

The work here demonstrates my understanding of:

- Preparing and cleaning datasets for machine learning.
- Applying supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms.
- Evaluating model performance with appropriate metrics.
- Using the **CRISP-DM** framework for end-to-end data mining projects.
